# MATLAB-Motion-Detector-by-Frame-Substraction
This project is a Motion Detector which is achieved by frame subtraction. It also find the centroid of every detected object with a boundary (bounding box) around it. 
It is coded in the MATLAB Software. It doesn't exactly detects motion in a video but it captures a new frame and find the motion detected in. 
Anyways, the most important thing is there are few different files in this repository. One of them is a .txt file which just has all the MATLAB code pasted in it. 
Then we have the report of the project which shows the purpose of every command used in the code.

Hope you like it!
